# Notes about the Experiment folder

The files in this folder were used for a conference paper for ANNSIM 2024. Since 
then, VISHN has been optimized significantly and the experimental setup is no 
longer compatible with newer versions of VISHN. If you would still like to 
reproduce the results of the experiment, vishn_old.py is an older version of 
VISHN which can run the experiments.
